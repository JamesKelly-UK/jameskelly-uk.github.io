        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
            My name is James Kelly, I currently work as a Solutions Consultant. Recently due to a change in position I've begun working with ECM (Enterprise Content Management) and workflow solutions, this has been a change from my long history in IT and Print.<br>
            The purpose of this website is for me to journal ideas and problems which I've encountered during my career journey. I also thought it would be a great project to create a site from scratch using the Hugo backend.<br>
